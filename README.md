## Angular 2 Data Table

This is a heavily modified version of ggmod's angular-2-data-table. It was originally made for one specific project. It is available for anyone to use, but contains no documentation or examples.

A simple Angular 2 data table, with built-in solutions for features including:

* pagination
* sorting
* row selection (single/multi)
* expandable rows
* column resizing
* selecting visible columns

The component can be used not just with local data, but remote resources too: for example if the sorting and paging happen in the database.

The templates use bootstrap CSS class names, so the component requires a bootstrap .css file to be present in the application using it.

## Installing:
`npm install @tuupertunut/angular-2-data-table --save`
